Zapier not only has a host of \""do this, then that\"" automated procedures but I can also write my own! I do e-commerce and need to spend most of my time designing for my printed products and this program does all the promoting or at least 90% of it for me!"",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: A handful of the automated tasks are not maintained because they are created by the users, not the business, Zapier. That means they may not work or could vanish without warning."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Because I do e-commerce selling clothing, accessories, and various other print-on-demand products, I have to spend most of my time designing, tweaking, or initially writing text, and keywords, making trend changes, and much, much more, I do not have time to take individual products and push them from, say, Amazon to Facebook, then Facebook to Instagram, and so on. This program saves me the valuable time I need. I am always looking for ways to save time. Not shortcuts, but time. Largely it is fashion or the fashion industry I am in and that is massive...so is the time involved.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-7292724","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",25,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

Zapier connects everything we use, making all of our software even more powerful. We've found that Zapier is more straightforward and malleable than adding Salesforce Apps directly from the app store. It also costs less than adding apps one by one through Slack. The number of connections are endless."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: It can get complicated! I still struggle with some Zaps not working how I need them to work. For example, we have trouble with our IPN for PayPal, and I still can't get the Zap exactly right. Each Zap is a time investment up front. It also takes some maintenance; our Zaps will occasionally shut off or no loner meet our needs. It requires a good amount of brainpower to make them work correctly, but it's always been worth it in the long run."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: We use Zapier to solve two main categories of problems: (1) automatic reminders/check-ins, and (2) automatic data entry. For reminders and check-ins, we use Zapier to automate our team accountability. When a Zapier \""robot\"" asks for a quick status update on Slack, it saves managers a task and feels more neutral to the team. We use Zapier to call people together for Scrums without nagging. Also, Zapier saves us a lot of time in data entry! Syncing Salesforce, MailChimp, Eventbrite, and PayPal helps us transfer information back and forth without having to manually enter transactions.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: Organic""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-5212957","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",50,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

What fascinates me is that it creates connections and links between applications that are not interconnected to each other by any means, then you can create a \""zap\"" to set in motion a task between applications. You can create your own zaps or look for them in the online community of this platform. In the main dashboard it offers you a set of recommendations on how integrations can be used and a simple button to test this process. The truth is that this platform is very useful, this automates many processes with just one trigger and the actions can be from a notification to save files and back them up in the cloud."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: Some conditions in the zaps can fail to practice, it is not as intuitive as you think. In some cases, the multi-task of zaps can become a bit overloaded for the processes, in this case it would be much better to keep the native integrations between apps. Another disadvantage is the extra charge on some platforms, it is something you should know beforehand."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: If you want to put your business in automatic mode you can get Zapier, there are many similar products, but none have more than 1000 apps to connect, and every week the community is active, create more integrations to try it for yourself. I say it with property that this platform scales production one hundred percent."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Zapier is indispensable in some processes that we have in the company, such as automating notifications through email and tracking and recording activities. The different zaps that we have on the dashboard help the workflow to be done without interruptions and in the simplest way without further use of other programs. With Zapier you can integrate our web applications simply.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-3289833","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",88,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

And I found learning it through trial and error actually helped me work out the system more. I've implemented Zapier to help me connect with Mondays and Active Campaign, with zapier acting as the middleman almost between the 2 platforms for updating my AC database, and it's been so simple. I've since implemented it for another Active Campaign and Eventbrite integration - and again, it's been working flawlessly. Wherever I have had questions - there is a support team at hand who can help answer them and direct you to handy guides and pre-set flows that you can quickly setup and just amend the details, and the email notifications that are sent if a error occurs means I don't have to keep logging in daily to monitor the zap flows. They offer regular webinars and training courses for users of Zapier to jump onto which I've found myself tuning into multiple times to hear about different use cases from other businesses and how else Zapier can work efficiently for a business - it's definitely something I would implement into my business further as we're working through streamlining our processes currently. There's multiple pricing structures to suit how many integrations, zaps and connections you need per account and you can upgrade or downgrade flexibly as it suits your business. And it's recently integrated AI features so you can use their AI to design a zap flow for you - of which I've tested this a few times and found personally it works well with clear and precise prompts, but they're definitely on the right track."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: I found if you're diving into Zapier without ever using it before it may not appear as simple to use on the initial outset - but once you play around with the system a bit it does become easier. Some of the fields can be labelled differently which can make them hard to understand which field should match with which on certain connections - so I've found myself a few times referring to support articles to help set up zap flows, but otherwise it's nothing that would make me stop using it."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Between Active Campaign and Eventbrite - the in channel connection between the 2 meant I was consistently facing issues with integration and it wasn't possible unless I added a 3rd party app. Since implementing Zapier, I've been able to have all of my eventbrite registrations and attendes automatically added to Active Campaign in a seperate list, tagged under my bespoke labelling, added into automations based on zapier prompts and it continues my email cycle from there - without me having to manually monitor anything. This also meant any follow up emails from Active Campaign to be sent based on attendance of the event could also be setup ready based on Zapier tags of whether they had checked in or not, and again, added to the relevant automation from there. Between Active Campaign and Mondays - again there was no in-channel connection and we use both systems heavily, so for our marketing comms (both b2b and b2c) we use AC, although our clients data is stored on Mondays. This meant finding a way to integrate the two, of which Zapier allowed me to make the connection via webhooks. Implementing Zapier meant that whenever a new contact was added to Mondays, they would automatically be added to Active Campaign into a seperate list, enter into multiple automations to set up their tags and I would receive an email if there was an error to make me aware. Zapier has helped me to take some of the manual stress of data entry and make it become automated across 3 different platforms - and it's now essential to the business.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-8982069","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",13,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

Among the web applications that support are Asana, Twitter, Gmail, GitHub, Jira, Salesforce, Dropbox reaching a list of more than 1250 business applications. This web based platform has a free version which you use to test the software allows you to do 5 zaps in total and up to 100 tasks per month with different price plans depending on what you want to achieve."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: One of the few but important things that i don't like about the program was that it is not implemented on any mobile platform which takes productivity and flexibility away from users who work most of the time with their smartphones since they can't be in front of a PC or a laptop all the time, and since the specs of cellphones nowadays are reaching the ones from a desktop i do not see why not to develop a mobile application."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: Zapier has a wide variety of plans for the different needs of any business. If you reach a limit of 5 shoes and which can be executed 100 times a month then you should improve to one of the paid plans, reaching up to 50,000 tasks per month and about 125 zaps and if this does not suit you offers you a personality option to satisfy your needs. Zapier is a very powerful application to integrate several systems making your visibility a little more visible on the online, so if you only use a couple of tools you won't find it very useful but if you manage tasks through more than ten different services then it definitely will improve your business drastically."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: One of the things that really came to me useful was in the creation and activation of events through multiple software applications, helping me in the automation of tasks in my work. Being an application designed for the regular user allows you to configure your processes. The number of applications that can be integrated is impressive, something i have not seen in any other software, given various compatibility issues that normally prevent full expansion with other systems. It has really boost my productivity at work by automating my daily tasks and helping me maintain a very high level of efficiency.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-3342255","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",88,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

There have been several occasions when the \""zaps\"" are not working as intended. Though it guides you through connecting the app, Zapier does not do an excellent job at helping you troubleshoot for errors when they do occur. The other part we are not fond of is the support system. Yes, they do contact you every time you submit a ticket; however, the delays in getting your project done can take much more than anticipated because every recommendation from support can take you a few minutes, but the turnaround time is much longer. We can understand that support cannot be familiar with every single app they intergrade with. Still, we feel there are better ways of communicating with customers for troubleshooting than an email every couple of hours."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: This app is undoubtedly a great tool to work with automation. Before zapier, we had to collect our leads from various sources manually and then add them to our CRM. Fast forward to the day we began using Zapier, and it makes sure all our lead sources are connected to our CRM, where we review the information and then have our CRM take over from there.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-5028124","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",57,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

Also, the \""steps\"" are really clunky. I don't know why they auto scroll, or any the text is so big. You have to look at each step individually; looking at all steps was much better in the original interface.

Also, the possibilities are wide. One of the aspects I enjoy a lot is the pre-made zaps. They are really useful when it comes to finding automations that I did not know I needed. The app is pretty complete and it seems like if there is an app out there that provides an API (not sure if it is standard for all apps to provide one), then you are very likely to find it in Zappier. This might sound silly but I enjoy their newsletter; it is usually loaded with ideas on what to set up. But this could be because I personally am a sucker for automations.  The user interface is pretty easy and, well, there's the advantage that you do not need to know how to code. It is actually exciting when you are setting up zaps as the process is streamlined. It has a clean look and it does what it promises pretty niftily. I have not had any issues so far."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: Maybe this is not something to dislike but I only get five free automation.  I am a solo freelancer and do not really need that many automations. This makes the plan prices a bit high for me. But then, if I were to ever need, say, six automations, I have to cancel one to make space for that other one (the free version only allows five automations). This is one of the reasons why some apps are creating automations of their own within the app so that you can connect with other apps without having to use Zapier. However, I am sure Zapier still has a strong clientele base.  I love automatic processes and the more I could have, the better, but I don't really have the financial bandwidth to pay $30/month. I guess it is worth it if you have a more robust business that relies a lot on automatic processes.  Also, the technical aspect is sometimes hard to grasp. I have found myself spending a lot of time trying to figure out how to make a process work. I think you cannot expect Zapier to solve all of your issues, there are some things that you will need to do by yourself. I have tried some things and they will simply not work. I honestly do not know if this is Zapier's fault or each particular app. For instance, when I tried to set up something very specific for ClickUp, there was a limit to how far into that app was able to get. Again, I don't know if this is Zapie or ClickUp."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: Things can get pretty technical when setting up your own zaps. Make sure you know what you are doing. The tool is super useful but it will probably not solve all of your automation issues. Take advantage of the pre-made zaps and make sure they will work for you."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: The app is built to help you save time. I am a freelancer and currently getting a bevy of time-consuming tasks done. I hate entering data or doing repetitive tasks, so Zapier is a great help. If you hate data entry like me, then this is the app that will help you get things done. For instance, if you want to trigger emails sent to a particular client, there is a limited type of actions you can make.  The major benefit you will get is organization. At least that is the major benefit for me. I am able to have crips Google spreadsheets with all the information I need in one place.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-5088335","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",47,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

It will allow you to up your game, reduce your costs (in time) focus on growth and be better then the competition with customer service.  Try it, they have a trial and you will not be disappointed."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Automating triggers after purchase of a product, automating signatures, automating the tagging people people based on having signed a document, automating SMS messages to go out when they haven't taken an action, automating data extraction from a database and entry into a google sheet when they have purcashed a product or service (for example for an event we need the information in a google sheet for registration purposes).

It really saves the hassle of writing our own scripts to tie API's together.

We use it for example to automatically create Trello tickets for our internal shopping requests that people send in using an Google Form."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: The learning curve of creating a zap can be high for some.

I would love to be sent on a journey to find a company that COULDN'T benefit from Zapier-- even if it is a mom and pop sandwich shop, that has a Zap that sets off a sound snippet anytime someone buys the sandwich of the day.

Using Zap, we can hook into our API and grab data without taking our DEVS away from their tasks.  I've used it to create automatic posts within our share company blog, using WordPress.  It was the first time one of my zaps didn't work-- and while I was talking through it to my technical counterpart- I clicked into something THINKING it would MAYBE be the fix. and sure enough- it was.

Attributes give incredible flexibility in organizing documents, syncing with Salesforce or other systems."",""Question: What do you dislike about Docusign CLM? - Answer: The interface is dated and inconsistent. Icons are the opposite of intuitive, the sync application is buggy and error-laden with conflict resolution a constant, painful fact of life.  Security is immature without the ability to allow users to administer user  access or manage workflows, but limit their access to sensitive documents. (e.g. a super user has access to everything).  You need an advanced degree to attempt workflow creation or modification and only a developer has a chance of succeeding.  Search is painful. For example, search results cannot be configured to display a full path, so multiple results in similarly named folders appear identical in search results.  Sharing is archaic and cumbersome. Few options exist for controlling how inside or outside links are managed, expire, controlled.  The Salesforce integration app is slow and unintuitive.

Our secondary objective was centralized cloud document storage. As to the first, the setup was challenging with the complexities of setting up workflow representing a significant barrier, but ultimately successful in storing and associating the documents.

"https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews",5219950,2115990,"Stephanie W.","Salesforce Admin","Mid-Market (51-1000 emp.)",3.5,"2022-06-21","Review on Zapier","[""Question: What do you like best about Zapier? - Answer: Very pleased with Zapier's feature to integrate two software for e.g. I can easily update fields in Salesforce, and it would get automatically get updated in Asana. The same applies from Salesforce to Asana. I also like the following add ons 1. the ability to zap different sections in the same Asana project 2. the ability to search for records and update 3. the ability to filter for records 4. the ability to delay some zaps."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: There are a few items I dislike because it takes a lot of time:  1. while testing: the records don't pick up the most recent changes even though it says it does. This happens especially if we have a lot of zaps in the same account. 2. zapping picklist fields is painful: one has to copy the IDs of each of the picklist value and add them one by one to Zapier. 3. search filter is not very smart: you can be scrolling forever to search for your project. It doesn't automatically show you the project name when using the search, you have to keep scrolling till you find it. 4. if your data doesn't match from Asana to Salesforce, the Zap will show that one of the steps is broken and needs to be fixed. This is not very helpful as the zap is not broken and is still working. Which thankfully is a good thing."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: Zapier can be used to update or create new records from one platform to another immediately. We have used it for Asana to Salesforce or Airtable to Salesforce. It is easy to setup and learn. There are some pain points in the user experience or product limitations e.g. picklist fields and their values are a bit difficult to update. The search for test records or looking for projects could be improved. Other should consider it if they need to integrate it with their CRM and other platforms. I think they provide you unlimited zaps package and may have reasonable price compared to other tools. So, that helps if your team uses it quite heavily. Support is good but they don't do screen share and only respond on emails. That is not efficient at all, and different reps take the case, so you may be repeating your case to them and still not resolve it."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Updating records from Salesforce to Asana and vice versa. The benefits are as follows: a. Less license needed to be assigned to users in both platforms. Salesforce users stay in Salesforce and Asana users stay in Asana. Both get immediate updates. b. Saves a lot of time for project managers in going back and forth looking for information. They can focus on completing the project instead of gathering information. More efficient. c. Saves a lot of manual steps for the users.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: Organic""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-5219950","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",41,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

We work with several 'integrators', like Zapier, to connect 3rd party pieces of software for our clients.  There are some that require aa high level of technical (e.g. API) abilities, but Zapier makes that process much easier.  They have prebuilt API integrations that make the integration process 'drop down' simple.  Just choose what you want to have happen, and what you want it to do on the other end, and you've got a connection."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: Zapier does not allow for lots of variability inside the Zap.  For example, if you need you to run a decision path (choose A or B based on criteria), and then you need to have another decision path that happens further down the line, you can't do that.  So, if you wanted to run a Zap that will decide \""male or female' to do various things based on their gender, you can do that, but, if they choose 'male' and then you want to run another decision based on \""under 30 years old' or 'over 30 years old', you can't do that.  You would need to create 2 Zaps with a filter at the beginning of each one that filters out the other gender.  For the standard user, this may not be a big impediment, but when you are building complex and/or 'living' automations that changed based on need, this can be a hindrance."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: Look at Integromat as an alternative, as the pricing structure can be significantly different, based on your needs.  Integromat also allows for multiple decision branding, unlike Zapier (as outlined elsewhere in the review.)"",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: We are eliminating the need for duplicate data entry and/or copy/pasting, which saves lots of time and energy and eliminates the potential for human interaction error.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-4203523","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",71,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

I wish that there were more video tutorials or shared group sessions to learn from past experiences. Overall, it's not difficult but would like a more streamlined approach. The admin backend is a little difficult to manage at times and wish you could add multiple users to one account without it costing too much."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: Think outside of the box. The application is super flexible and can do a number of activities and zaps that meet the needs of any business. Don't overthink the applications or zaps. Overthinking can actually cause the system to have to overprocess and you could run into a lot of errors and things you may not be ready to handle without expert help."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: I am able to solve a slew of problems with Zapier.

It has many Zaps that are templates over other popular software. These zaps can be connected and synchronized to be able to use and integrate several applications within your systems. This facility to integrate new applications generates that the work is easier to do and that you do not have to exchange applications continuously, since you have their integrations within the software."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: The use of folders is somewhat complex, since they are somewhat messy and you have to spend a little while finding out where each of them is.  I believe that in the future they could improve and facilitate the distribution of the folders so that less time was lost in identifying them and also making it easier to sort them."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: Basically Zapier allows you to spend less time doing your tasks but keep doing them with the same efficiency as before. It also allows you to integrate and use several applications at the same time. I believe that saving time while improving profitability is something useful for any company."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: It has achieved that, for example, the forms that our clients have to fill in is much simpler. Zapier automates the flow of emails and SMS and allows you to send them, notifies you if they have answered the forms and can check the details and follow up.  The daily workflow has been reduced. We do not lose as much time as before in several applications and it is easier for us to send documents through this platform and also the use of different Zaps so that certain tasks that were previously more complex are now easier through the intergration that this software provides us. .""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-1886413","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",96,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

Many tech on this website is not currently available. Over time, task plans can be a daunting task, not always working correctly. The workflow is constrained to no more than three methods, so you will not drill into the workflow. I agree that the greatest challenge is that it presents so many options that frequently it's incredibly difficult to decide what to suggest, because you have a great deal of imagination to make use of, not least technology without invention."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: This is the app you need to get things done if you're not a programmer and want to talk coding together. Just look through the package. The software is incredibly flexible and can handle a range of tasks and zaps to fulfill the needs of each organization. Don't zapp or apps sugarcoat. Overthinking can contribute to overprocessing of your computer, so that you can make many errors that you can't manage without professional support."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Speak to a different site for our CRM, which lets me upgrade my details. We struggled to gather all our data in our separate method without any internal support, but when we began using Zapier the bulk of our issues were overcome. One of the most helpful things I did was to build and cause events in different programming applications, which helped me to simplify my work. As a typical user-created software, the operations are customized. The number of programs that can be introduced is extraordinary because, because of unique compatibility problems that usually preclude complete integration of all other programmes, I have not seen them with any other system.

The Zaps are used to handle tasks from a single screen, but they are configured for multiple applications such as social networks, e-mails, project management systems, etc. Everyone in our business saves a lot of time and much of the chances of human error was removed."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: I don't like Zapier because only recent events are considered when taking test data; this is an issue if I choose to use older events. And that restricts me a little in certain things I want to do with this software. Many aspects can be changed, but I don't like anything in particular. In the market, there is no better alternative. Don't shut it even."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: It needs to be Zapier that anyone stares at. It's crazy how much and how much you can support. The more you understand, the more ways you can boost your quality management and save time. The trick to using Zapier is to learn how to render zaps easy and quick, and how to handle zaps. I recommend that you explore the Internet if you are a novice and are still interested in their helpdesk, which will direct them through the initial stages."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Almost all is programmed. Documents automate the everyday sales and customer care operation. We now simplify our payment systems too. E-mail alerts automatically. Edit Google Boards. Show data within sheets. With just a few changes, Zapier lets us merge our applications in a single tool, saving us a great deal of time and effort and easy and effective data replication through multiple media. The approach has greatly improved our levels of efficiency and encouraged the growth of our operations.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-4563653","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",65,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

The simple functionality lets us program actions the way we would draw them out on paper.

It is simply the easiest content management system out of the top 23 vendors in the ECM space. The basic search feature shows advanced functionality because the results show how likely the document is to produce what you were searching for. Adding metadata is incredibly easy because of the split screen: you can view the document and see the metadata fields at the same time so your metadata entry will be less likely to produce errors. The alerts received by email are easy to enter and the emails are reliable so you do not miss an auto-renew deadline and be on the hook for money you did not want to pay and relationships that are not working out. The reports that are generated are also easy and Greg was very helpful working with me to make sure my reports and rules for workflows were functioning properly and providing me what I asked for and more."",""Question: What do you dislike about Docusign CLM? - Answer: The advanced search functionality could be more simple for the view-only/casual user."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Docusign CLM: - Answer: Ask for anything and allow them to build it.

No developer or freelancer need to recruit. You may set it irrespective of the budget or organization's scale. I like it will for example, collect data from one source to a Google sheet, and then trigger another rule from this sheet. It's helpful to customize those zaps to simplify a process when you don't have the money in your squad to function right away."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: It may often be a little timid to set up a new zap, so you can erase all the previous data from the sheet if you have data which are moved to a Google sheet, and there is a mistake in the sheet or someone fills a cell. It's really useful except that. My only criticism is that the support system is not sufficient. The technical help will take days to get a response. I'd prefer that chat help be included. This is an enormous contribution to the Zapier experience of customer service."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: It is easy to set up and use and increases teams' performance by giving them fast access to data. It gives you plenty of versatility to acquire knowledge, to pick those areas, etc. Before setting it up, I suggest making sure the device is zapier compliant. It takes me time to look at which applications can be checked on the website with zapier."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Start to understand how knowledge can be accessed from one location to a computer, without taking multiple measures to discover this.

It allows our phones to perform their everyday tasks, since they now complement one another through Zapier with applications working separately as Dropbox and Gmail."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: Zapier doesn't have anything to worry about. The problem of error detection after configuring a zap would be one of the critical aspects of the program.

There are also some times when I have to use other, more restricted tools, because Zapier does not analyze the data."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: Although it is easy to set up a Zapier over time, I encourage new users to spend time on how to correctly configure it because their automation advantages lose value if they are not practicing when and how to install it.

This software offers numerous automation options, meaning I can spend more time in another product. Configuration can be intimidating if they are not used to automation software; Zapier provides a set of community-built automations that any client can use in such a situation.

Apart from the occasional hiccups, it has always done the jobe for me. It is quite pricey, but mostly worth it."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: Please beware, their plans / billing structure is built in a way that you as a customer can be screwed over easily. Let me explain.  I have bought a yearly plan a while back. I wasn't using it as much anymore so I asked them if they could refund it. In their help docs they advised to \""Please downgrade to your preferred plan here before making a refund request, so we can address your request faster.\"" So I did that and mailed them about a refund.  Turns out I wasn't eligible for a refund since my yearly plan was purchased over 3 months ago. Which was fine with me, no worries.. BUT: I had now downgraded my account and even upon asking them they would NOT give me access to the yearly plan I paid for again. When downgrading, nowhere did it mention I could not gain back access to my yearly plan.  Instead they told me I had to either use the remaining balance in my account to switch to a (more expensive) monthly plan or renew my yearly plan (meaning to pay for another year minus the outstanding account balance).  Basically I now have a dead Zapier account, despite having paid for a year of service, that I can't use without either switching to a more expensive monthly plan or paying them more for a new yearly plan.  I can still use the account balance to buy a new plan at any time in the future, but they will not give me back access to the yearly plan that I paid for in advance.  Supposedly \""the system doesn't allow for that\"". Translation: We'd rather earn a bit more money off you.  Customer service had nothing else to tell me than \""we've decided that subscription upgrades/downgrades result in new billing and Task usage cycles\"". So in short, they are happily misleading customers into paying them more and more.  Should you go over your task limit, the system simply holds tasks, which can cause whole business processes to fail. Instead of allowing you to pay for surplus tasks after the fact, you basically are held hostage and need to always buy a plan that has some leeway to be on the safe side. Paying by tasts would be better. Also, the email features are very basic, so you always need to implement an external email service."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: Be aware that their customer service is terrible for the amount of money they charge."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Connecting apps and automating things especially in regards to email marketing, connecting shop software with delivery of digital products and billing.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: Organic""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-4873485","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",60,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

This software may be even available for small information flows, but the best of these is the possibility to integrate social network behavior with other applications."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: I can only criticize Zapier for having no choice to use conditioning Zaps, which is an excellent tool that helps users keep their tasks in certain order and precision.

The program would often breakdown communication between Salesforce and SpringCM, not filling in the template fields as needed or at all. It dropped information regularly. We never got a fix. 2. The workflow is limited. Our work orders/contracts have many variables for approvers and reviewers. That  was unwieldy and at times not functional within the SpringCM environment.  3 The initial setup was a nightmare. It was confusing and took nearly a year while we paid for the service but could not use it. We had to be almost as tech savvy as they were with workflow issues in order to advise them how to build it.  We needed expert advice, not just a tech head. Technical support was expensive. We needed more template making (required coding) and that was at a premium.

They continue to say this is trying to be resolved. The catch, is that the zaps will choose at random times to run a series of gmail labeled emails from the past. So, for example, at around 8 pm each evening, it will run 20 zaps that are from the past several weeks. In essence, duplicating and triplicating zaps again and again and from the past - for all purposes they are old old zaps that are firing again. To say we have been frustrated is an understatement.  After communicating yet again yesterday to attempt to come up with a better solution to avoid this glitch that is currently not resolved, we received an automated message that we were about to go over our allotted number of zaps for the month. We have already upgraded to the second from top tier as well as have limited other zaps that are considered nice to have, but not critical to daily business operations.  This evening, I messaged the customer service and over the course of a series of emails was told that even though they know this is a glitch on zapier's part, and even though it is deducting from our few thousand zaps each month, they will not add zaps back in to ensure we are not dealing with held zaps and that there is basically nothing they can do. So, from a business perspective, they advertise one thing, but IF the software misfires and triggers incorrectly through no fault of the consumer - they will still charge you - again, and again, and again.  We had an issue over a year ago and I was hesitant at that time about renewing, but was pleased with the manager that had reached out and sincerely apologized for the error on their part so we continued forward. However, this error and known error on Zapier's part that they have willingly admitted to is just beyond baffling that they penalize the consumer. Find another alternative."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: Find another alternative. Zapier, when it works well, is good.

Doing multiple programming tasks makes it hard for us to manage some of the steps. But using Zapier with some of our projects makes it bearable and more accessible for us. First, they have managed to integrate a thousand applications into their end, selecting which triggers and action you want to have.

What I mean is, I think what they can do for Free users is they can create a Zap, they can choose a premium app and test it, but you can't make a Zap live if you're not a premium so that we could check our custom zaps with other API's. Also, they should implement sandbox API endpoints. For example, Paypal has a sandbox API endpoint; they should have those and not just the production and direct API endpoints to use."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: Having the ability to implement and use other API efficiently, you can use Zapier the most.

They've recently updated the layout and design of the zap-creation process to be a bit more user-friendly, and they seem to be adding apps and integrations all the time.  I like that you can create multiple zaps and organize them into folders, and that you can duplicate an existing zap or automation process as a starting point for a new one."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: There's a bit of a learning curve when you first get started. Zapier makes it about as easy as they can for what they do - it's complex to tie together entirely separate tech software systems and apps and make them work together - but it will take you a few hours at first when you create your first couple zaps.  Sometimes the test Zap feature can be frustrating to figure out, and can clutter up your systems a bit by creating redundant or \""fake\"" contacts or records. But there's probably no other way for this kind of technology to properly test and implement an API based automation, so what can you do?  After it \""clicks\"" for you, though, you'll think differently about your business operations and want to hunt down different ways to reduce manual work. Each hour you invest into creating/refining your zaps and automations will have a large ROI in future hours of work saved."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Saving time on manual labor! For example, when a prospect schedules a meeting on Calendly, Zapier automatically 1) creates a new contact in our CRM, 2) carries over the scheduler information into the client's new profile in our CRM, 3) creates a contact record in our email campaign software, 4) starts a corresponding workflow in our workflow/operations system.  If all of that was done manually by an admin assistant one by one, it would probably take 10 minutes. If you have 200 leads/prospects in a year, that \""zap\"" automation alone saves you over 30 hours of labor. Multiply that by any other processes you can use Zapier for, and it's a huge time and cost saver.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-5065903","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",55,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

Probably it happens here if you thought of an integration. It's incredibly simple to walk through the installation-there 's no need for an IT degree or NASA scientist. Zapier can be used for paid and free membership packages that provide packages like mail, project management and documentation tools, which are mostly used in business life. Briefly, Zapier is a user friendly web service that enables transactions between various web applications that are used everyday by you to be automated."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: Zapier is only available free of charge. This is maybe Zapier only shortcoming and drawback. But seeing this as a significant drawback is not right. However, any improvements in this regard can be positive. You can make a little expensive if you have set up a variety of \""zaps\"" and a large number of people using them. I would suggest that I look at the point and maybe streamline your workflows."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: Zapier refers to Zap integrations and enables the development of your own zaps using an editor. You have to set the trigger format after choosing the framework with the built-in applications and common applications choices. Check for their integrations before you purchase them and then try them out. The price is so low to pursue, why not? Don't fear the advanced choices! It's better than you guess."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: However, if you like, you can run code with Run JavaScript, Run Python. I used a term \""without code\"" for Zapier use. You can also explicitly control these procedures, of course, by selecting applications, within the program that you choose. We have many designers who receive applications from a Wufoo application form. The requests must then be made via Slack to people on a clock and then be sorted, allocated, worked on, and so on in our project management systems.

In such way, it is unscalable, unreliable, costly, and cumbersome.

Zapier has allowed us to take labour intensive tasks out of day to day activities by setting up automation's which do these tasks for us. Zapier can allow you to set up a really basic automation, which is two actions, to a more complex  zap with multiple steps. In our company we use Airtable as our main app for day to day work and currently have over 100 individual Zaps performing tasks and connecting to various other apps on the final action. When creating a Zap, I've found a really useful tool to be the Zapier 'Helpers'. You can add a helper to your zap after the step 1 (the trigger) and you can then add a filter, which will only allow step 1 to continue when a condition is met, for example, 'IF NAME > CONTAINS > SMITH'. This will only allow records from step 1 with SMITH to continue to the next step. You can also create a delay with your Zaps, giving you control of what time you'd like these actions to run. My favourite Helper is 'Formatter' which allows you to run formulas, change date/time and edit text (remove HTML, replace words, split text, etc.). Zapier Helper is such a useful tool when building your Zaps and I highly recommend looking at these when doing so!"",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: One issue I do have with Zapier is that when an error occurs on a Zap, it does not make it clear as to why this is happening. Usually it will just say that an error has occured and will let you know what Zap has errored but does not give a detailed description as to why this has happened. When you have lots of Zaps running with multiple connections, this can be a bit of a pain. I will say that this is me nitpicking and it's only on the odd occasion that an error will occur."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: I recommend spending a lot of time playing with Zapier and building a variety of zaps with different complexities, during the testing phase of implementing. This will give you a clear understanding of how Zapier works and the knowledge of building zaps is a very important tool to have. I also recommend searching all the apps and online programs you use, to see if Zapier can be integrated in any way. This could help you automate and take out some labour intensive tasks from your day to day activity."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Automating tasks between apps has been the biggest problem we've solved since using Zapier. We've been able to create multiple Zaps which run over different periods of time, allowing a seamless transition of data. There are many benefits to using Zapier, from the sheer amount of apps you can connect together, to the variety of tasks you can perform and the levels of complexity you would like to set when creating a task. Any new online software or app we now use, I always check to see if it can be integrated through Zapier!""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-4102393","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",72,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

It can automate many processes that you have had to do manually in the past. The way it works is that you set up \""tasks\"" (or rules if you'd like) that the program needs to do. You then connect to a software you want Zapier to be able to handle (for example, Quickbooks) by using what is called an API Key (only available if Zapier is integrated with this application). This key lets Zapier read information from the program - for example - \""deposit paid\"" and then set in motion a range of actions such as trying to find a bartender for that client etc. Zapier is great because they integrate with the most software of the ones we have tried!"",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: Zapier is a great tool and is the competitor on the market with the most API Key integrations, however, they are also the most expensive. They have been cutting down and downgrading their tiers for a while which keeps forcing us to upgrade our account to reach the same amount of tasks we had available before. For example, we used to have 1500 tasks in a month, but since they downgraded that to 1000, we had to upgrade to the 2000 tasks/month plan. I think Zapier needs to decide on a price level and tiers and stick to it."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Zapier has allowed us to automate much of our operations. One example is our website booking system. We looked around for developers who could build an automated system where a client can book their event/bartender without as much manual typing/confirmation on our end - one said he could do it for thousands of dollars. Instead we went with Zapier which costs us as little as $49 a month! That is a lot of money saved. Additionally, we have been able to expand the automated systems to other areas of our business without paying anything additionally.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-4247250","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",70,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

It let you do almost everything without the need of having a programmer close to you. It's basically for automate task but you can actually go deep and create really cool integrations. From a simple form that automatically fills a google sheet and sends SMS and email at the same time; to a CRM that when you fill a form it automatically create a card in Trello assigns it and print contracts with Google cloud print. Here your imagination and skills will be your limit."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: For most people around 5 integrations and 100 tasks per month are far enough unfortunately for me 75,000 task is just not enough and the pricing per task after that can be really expensive if you are not careful. also, it would be nice if zaps were refreshed in the moment even if you pay the most that zapier refresh is like 3 minutes not bad but real time would be nice."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Payment Succesful example: a user pays through a payment gateway like stripe, stripe tells zapier and zapier depending on the transaction if it was successful it sends a customizable email through a service like mailjet. Payment declined for example: if it wasn't succesfull then you can send a payment failed email with instructions for the customer to check his card with the bank. Engagement and churn example: If you want to automate and reward the customer who buy 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 times then you make a counter and every time the customer reaches a number of recurrent payments then you can send whatever you want a reward email, sms even calls.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-4216830","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",70,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"

DocuSign feature of envelope status is idiot proof. Users can track when the recipient opened the agreement and who is yet to sign. The expiration and the envelope's message can also be pre-set to save time and effort. The phone support staff is great, the customer rep is not knowledgeable."",""Question: What do you dislike about Docusign CLM? - Answer: I don't like the user interface and the consistency in the design element. For e.g, if I place text fields in a template and if another user with a lower screen resolution views it, the text boxes doesn't retail it's former position. It tends to move from the predefined position, coming across as unprofessional.  The other item I dislike is DocuSign's is their always need to hike prices. For small features such as merge fields that should be part of the product, they tend to up-sell it with huge amount. I don't like the way they treat their customers."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Docusign CLM: - Answer: I would recommend DocuSign based on it's easy tracking of envelopes - senders can be provided an entire history on when the envelopes were sent, opened, signed, and completed. DocuSign makes it easy to pre-set the envelope's message and the envelope's expiration date, which can be applicable for the entire organization. This pre-setting of message helps the sender save time from customizing the message per envelope.  In addition, if you are looking to make the envelopes private per team, DocuSign allows the flexibility of having a sub-folder per team. Each subfolder works the same way as the primary account folder with its own users and admins. Lastly, DocuSign integrates well with Salesforce. You can create a DocuSign template and call it from a button in Salesforce."",""Question: What problems is Docusign CLM solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: We use DocuSign CLM to send our invoices, legal and hiring documents. Gets the job done of signature and uploading to the correct place in the CRM.

I hate to say it but the price is high compared to other similar companies but they are good at what they do so it's hard to say whether I would switch to another company or not if they have similar features as I don't have a personal touch or experience with the company to maintain loyalty if I have to be honest.

It's the platform that takes you from one thing to the other. It connects the programs to seeminglessly work together to have your business work smoothly. I just love having the ability to bridge two platforms together and not worry. I like that I can use more than just one set of platforms to connect.  Once you learn how to connect each platform it gets easier because you know the foundation of how to bridge the gap. Last you can decide to either turn it on or off so some zaps will just be a draft until you are ready, then you just toggle it on. The upside to using zapier is having well-oiled machine that works behind the scenes connecting the programs needed for your business to work."",""Question: What do you dislike about Zapier? - Answer: I do not like having to figure out how to connect each platform together ....well for some platforms. It can get complicated depending on what you connecting. Looking at zapier at first looks intimidating because there is a lot you can do with the different programs. I hate when I can't figure out exactly how some programs zap and then I can't figure it out either from Youtube. The support system from zapier is ok but not the best. It's sometimes not clear what they're telling you so you feel like you drowning with trying to zap programs together. That's why I strongly advise learning exactly how to zap cause then it becomes easy after a while and its less headache."",""Question: Recommendations to others considering Zapier: - Answer: Make sure you learn exactly how you use zapier. It can get overwhelming on your own so there are lots of Youtube videos that will save you a lot of headaches. Also, make sure that you check your zaps and that it is actually working because that is the most important part. What exactly are you looking to use zapier for? Once you figure that outlook how others zap them together, then just practice zaping and storing them in drafts until you are ready to zap programs together. I would also recommend looking at what platforms use zapier. Even though most platforms use zapier not everything can be zapped together to make it seamless. Research before getting the platform and seeing what you need to connect and connect them together."",""Question: What problems is Zapier solving and how is that benefiting you? - Answer: Being able to use the majority of platforms and bridge the gap so that I can have funnels and emails and so much more connected on the back end. There are some programs that I need to zap together this made it possible. Some platforms you don't think you can zap (bridge, connect, etc)  trust me zapier does connect them such as trainerize and clickfunnels. One is where my business foundation is located and the other is where the logistics are.""]","[""Validated Reviewer"",""Verified Current User"",""Review source: G2 invite"",""Incentivized Review""]","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews/zapier-review-5065770","https://www.g2.com/products/zapier/reviews","Zapier",51,"Zapier",1,"most_recent"
